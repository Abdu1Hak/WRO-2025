# Chassis
Designing the chassis for our robot was a unique challenge as we had to create a base large enough and strong enough to handle the weight and size of our Rasberry Pi as well as the equipment needed to control and operate it, namely the large 12V battery needed.

## V0.0
Features:
  - 5x3 inch plate
  - Conjoined to front and rear axle assemblies through popsicle stick-like pieces and screws.

Issues:
  - Overly basic and primitive, unfit for our needs
    
## V1.0
Features:
  - Complete Redesign
  - Reshaped to be smaller, with protruding rectangle to allow steering system/front axle assembly to attach directly onto it with room for wheels to steer freely
  - Similar, yet smaller, protruding rectangle added to rear for drive system/rear axle assembly to attach to with room on both sides for tires

Issues:
  - Overly basic and primitive, unfit for our needs
