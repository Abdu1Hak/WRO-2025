# Drive
The drive system that powers are robot is a simple, elegant design whose concept was created from the start with simple improvements made throughout testing without major overhauls, therefore the different designs will go upwards from V0.

## V0.0
Features:
  - Metal differential mounted above chassis on differential supports in order to improve turning ability.
  - Metal gears to improve durability
  - Vertically mounted motor to reduce space.
  - Adapters to convert differential output into LEGO axles in order to utilize LEGO tires
Issues:
  - Differential is mounted too high, therefore we are forced to use overly-large tires.

## V0.1
Fixes:
  - Lowered differential by reduced height of bottom half of support, allowing us to use smaller and more compact tires.
Issues:
  - Axle adapters to which wheels bend from weight of chassis, causing robot to sag and bottom drag.
  - LEGO axles on axle adapters break easily.

## V0.2
Fixes:
  - Added 0.4 inch thick axle supports for the axle adapters to prevent sagging.
  - Changed material from which axle adapters are printed from basic PLA to PLA-CF (Carbon Fibre) to increase strength and prevent breakage.
Issues:
  - Increased friction from axle supports:
      Decreased speed
      Increased strain on motor
      Increased likeliness for axle adapter to break/fracture
      Increased waste of power
## V0.3
Fixes:
  - Redesigned slot within axle suports to fit ball bearings for axle adapters to fit through in order to reduce friction.
Issues:
