# Second Storey
The idea of a second storey was realized after Chassis V1.0 as creating room to house the Rasberry Pi, 12V battery, Camera, as well as a servo would be infeasable under the reasonable constraints places upon ourselves to have a compact, light robot that can complete the challenges simply and swiftly.

## V0.0
Features:
  - Simple 3.3x2.2 inch rectangle for Rasberry Pi to attach to.
  - Rasied edge with dimensions of 0.5x2.2 inch for camera to mount to.
  - Battery would velcro to underside.

Issues:
  - Camera eventually decided upon (Kano Webcam - 2.1 Megapixel - USB 2.0) does not need mount.

## V1.0
Features:
  - Plate designed to sit upon VEX Standoffs that will attach directly to Chassis (Chassis V1.1).
  - Atop plate sits a holder for Rasberry Pi.
  - 
Issues:
  - Not enough room for battery, hence Chassis V1.3.

## V2.0
Features:
  - Rasberry Pi mount is lowered and moved further back to make design more compact as well as to prevent and blockage of the view from the camera.
  - A 2.5 inch tall structure arises from the back of the second storey that acts as a camera mount for the new camera (Raspberry Pi Camera Module, Fisheye Lens)
      This contains a coutout from which a rectangular-shaped mount for the camera will sit, hanging from a cylinder that attaches through the entire structre, allowing the camera's angle to be adjusted.
    
Issues:
  - N/A.
