## Steering
 Throughout the process of iterating our robot, we explored and tested many different types of sterring systems in order to discover the most efficient, most durable and most "usable" design to enhance the efficacy of the robot. Those designs explored include:

 ### 1) Four-Bar Steering System
The Four-Bar Steering System was the first design that we tested. This essentially works by two long parallel bars and connecting them with two more shorter parallel bars, forming a rectangle, with the desried, frictionless wheels subsequently being placed on the centre of both shorter bars. For our specific iteration, we placed the wheels on the forward ends of the bars simply to give us some more space and to make it more "car-like" for lack of a better adjective. All four joints where the bars connect must be mobile in order to allow the angle of the wheels to change. The steering actuator is then connected to one of the longer bars to create movement. When one of the longer bars is translated horizontally with the other remaining stationary, the angle of the wheels will therefore change, permitting the robot to steer. This is arguably one of the most simple steering systems, and is likely the most adopted system by teams participating in WRO Future Engineers. FIX (ADD) THIS
### 2) *Double Pivot* Steering System
This steering system, although named "Double Pivot", is unlike the steering system originally patented by Karl Benz. This system works identically to the Four-Bar Steering System, the only difference is rather than the steering actuator being connected directly to the steering bar, the actuator and steering bar are both connected in parallel through a plate, thus allowing each connecting to rotate around one another. This negates our previous issue of an uncentred servo, but creates a far more serious issue in the fact that steering becomes more unpredictable. For example, if our wheels are anlged at +30 degrees and we bring them back to 0 degress but the plate moves from a vertical alignment to a horizontal alignment, the wheels will jump to a +5 degrees of -5 degress without warning, for example. This issue was a dealbreaker for us utilizing this steering system, making it necessary to find a superior system.

### 3) Dual Arm Steering System
The Dual Arm Steering System is a "cut above" the rest for our robot for a myriad of reasons. This system works similarly to the four-bar system, except the steering arm is instead replaced by two independent arms originating from either wheel-bar and connecting to a plate that is atttched to the steering actuator. This system offers numerous advantages as it prevent the previous "opposite arc" steering issue, it allows the servo the stay centred, it is predictable, and it allows the inner wheel to turn further than the outer wheel, creating smoother and better steering.
