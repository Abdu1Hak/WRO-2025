## Steering
 Throughout the process of iterating our robot, we explored and tested many different types of sterring systems in order to discover the most efficient, most durable and most "usable" design to enhance the efficacy of the robot. Those designs explored include:

 ### 1)Four-Bar Steering System
The Four-Bar Steering System was the first design that we tested. This essentially works by two long parallel bars and connecting them with two more shorter parallel bars, forming a rectangle, with the desried, frictionless wheels subsequently being placed on the centre of both shorter bars. For our specific iteration, we placed the wheels on the forward ends of the bars simply to give us some more space and to make it more "car-like" for lack of a better adjective. All four joints where the bars connect must be mobile in order to allow the angle of the wheels to change. The steering actuator is then connected to one of the longer bars to create movement. When one of the longer bars is translated horizontally with the other remaining stationary, the angle of the wheels will therefore change, permitting the robot to steer. This is arguably one of the most simple steering systems, and is likely the most adopted system by teams participating in WRO Future Engineers.
