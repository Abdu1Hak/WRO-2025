#Models


These are the individual parts that make up our final robot's build, having each part completely custom designed over using pre-made parts, such as LEGO, helped to keep our robot compact, efficient, and stable. Most of the parts were printed in standard PLA, however certain parts that are under excessive strain and are subject to breakage were printed in PLA-CF, or carbon fibre, to increase strength and reduce fragility. Some examples of these parts are the Axle Adapters or Steering Arms.

| [Chassis (5).STL](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/39ba8c59d8dfa675b6d5f0d3143fe6f86e9a5792/Models/V1/Chassis%20(5).STL) | The chassis is the base, the backbone of our robot, the part that everything is built off of. The chassis has four screw holes in the front for the fully assembled steering system/front axle assembly to attach directly into, making our design modular, and includes cutouts in the front to give room for the wheels to turn into. Behind this, there is a slot for the servo to slip into and rest in, with the walls perfectly hugging it to prevent the servo for flailing around. Further back down the chassis is a large rectangular enclosure to house the battery, having the battery veritcally mounted helps to reduce size and provide easier access to the battery outputs for power. Finally, fully at the back, the rear of the robot extends outwards to make room for both the axle supports as well as the motor and differential themselves. Between the screw holes for the differential supports, there is a small cutout for the differential to slip through in order to allow the rear axle to drop lower, aloowing us to utilize a wider variety of tires. |
| [2nd Storey (2).STL](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/2a226552c3a14dec3fb3a756474c238545f57a59/Models/V1/2nd%20Storey%20(2).STL) | The second storey attaches ontop of four VEX standoffs which attach directly into the chassis, it is a vital components as it houses the Raspberry Pi as well as having a portion that jets out veritacally to mount to camera, providing a high view of the game mat from the real-centre area of our robot. |
| [Axle Adapter (2).STL](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/2a226552c3a14dec3fb3a756474c238545f57a59/Models/V1/Axle%20Adapter%20(2).STL) | The Axle Adapters (2) help to convert the differential output into a part compatible with our tires by combining a part that fits into the differential output into a LEGO compatibile-axle that will go through the wheels to distribute power. |
| [Axle Supports (2).STL](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/2a226552c3a14dec3fb3a756474c238545f57a59/Models/V1/Axle%20Supports%20(2).STL) | The Axle Supports (2) screw into the rear corners of the chassis in order to provide support to the axles to prevent the sagging of the rear and bending of axles. The part has room built into it for ball bearings that the axle adapters pass through to reduce friction and to reduce wear. |
| [Diff. Support - STL.STL](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/2a226552c3a14dec3fb3a756474c238545f57a59/Models/V1/Diff.%20Support%20-%20STL.STL) | The Differential Supports (2) attach to the middle of the rear region of the chassis, around the cutout for the differential, for the ball bearings that are part of the differential to attach to. |
| [Motor Holder (1) - With Bearing.STL](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/2a226552c3a14dec3fb3a756474c238545f57a59/Models/V1/Motor%20Holder%20(1)%20-%20With%20Bearing.STL) | The Motor Holder sits atop the two differential supports with a large cut out with room for a ball bearing through which the bevel gear the provides power to the differential sits on, to reduce friction and increase efficiency. On either side of the cutout are two screw holes through which the motor itself attaches to. |
| [Front Arm (2).STL](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/2a226552c3a14dec3fb3a756474c238545f57a59/Models/V1/Front%20Arm%20(2).STL) | The Front Arm (2) are placed on the top and bottom of the front axle assembly and house the entire front axle assembly/steering system. It is this that attaches to the chassis and holds the [Wheel Holders](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/2a226552c3a14dec3fb3a756474c238545f57a59/Models/V1/Wheel%20Holder%20(2).STL). |
| [Steering Arms (1).STL](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/db369b3ebf4c5d7d19f8fa2ed4585c0516836f4c/Models/V1/Steering%20Arms%20(1).STL) | The Steering Arms (2) are the parts that transmits the direction from the servo to the wheel holders, attaching to the Steering Plate on one end and the Wheel Holder on the other end. |
| [Steering Plate (1).STL](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/db369b3ebf4c5d7d19f8fa2ed4585c0516836f4c/Models/V1/Steering%20Plate%20(1).STL) | The steering plate is a humble piece that sits atop the servo/steering actuator with two holes on each front corner for the Steering Arms to attach to, allowing them to move independently, increasing efficieny. |
| [Supports - STL.STL](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/db369b3ebf4c5d7d19f8fa2ed4585c0516836f4c/Models/V1/Supports%20-%20STL.STL) | The Supports (2) fit in between either Front Arm to hold it up, provide stability, and give space for the Wheel Holders. |
| [Wheel Holder (2).STL](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/db369b3ebf4c5d7d19f8fa2ed4585c0516836f4c/Models/V1/Wheel%20Holder%20(2).STL) | The Wheel Holders (2) are essential components as they hold the front tires through the cylindrical extensions that allow free rotation, attach between the wheel holders from the hole as the front with minimal friction, as well as directing steering with the Steering Arms attach to the rear hole on the Wheel Holder. |
| [End (1).STL](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/db369b3ebf4c5d7d19f8fa2ed4585c0516836f4c/Models/V1/End%20(1).STL) | This part (2) fits onto the end of the wheel holders just to prevent the wheels from falling off. |
| [Camera Mount (1).STL](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/db369b3ebf4c5d7d19f8fa2ed4585c0516836f4c/Models/V1/Camera%20Mount%20(1).STL) | The Camera Mounts fits into the slot within the Second Storey and is where the camera mounts to, with simple double-sided tape, and allows flexibility in the camera angle by sitting through Axle by rotating around it. |
| [Axle (0).STL](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/db369b3ebf4c5d7d19f8fa2ed4585c0516836f4c/Models/V1/Axle%20(0).STL) | The Axle sits on the Second Storey cut out for the camera mount, passing through the camera mount to allow the adjustment of the camera angle. |
| [Ends (0).STL](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/db369b3ebf4c5d7d19f8fa2ed4585c0516836f4c/Models/V1/Ends%20(0).STL) | This part (2) fits on the ends of Axle to prevent it from sliding out of the Camera Mount and Second Storey. |
