# WRO-2025

The README file will be the central home for all written documentation. It will elaborate on all sections

Things to consider as part of the README file:

1. Pictures - introductions
2. Identify the Objective of the Game
3. Our approach - general to focused, discussions, challenges, goal - issues we faced
4. Mobility Management - motors, chassi design, mounting of all components. speed, torque, power, etc - 3D - issues we faced
5. Power and Sense Management- camera, servos, battery, hat, their usage and what they do - issues we faced
6. Obstacle Management - how they interact with components, strategy of open and obstacle, parking,  program flow, conditions, logic diagrams, code blocks, and commmented code - issues we faced during the coding
7. Assembly Instructions
8. Improvements


## 1. Introduction

Team Members & Contacts
Repo Structure
Links to Jump to sections

## 2. Objective of the Game

What is this year's challenge - obstacle and open


## 3. What is our goal?

Considering our skill set - what areas did we prioritize, beginning challenges, and our goal to work towards

## 4. Mobility Management
## 5. Power and Sense Management
## 6. Software - Open Challenge - Obstacle Challenge - Parking

Identify the Logic flow, including code snippets, and provide pictures of the VNC

Using VNC:
How do we interact with the Pi and analyze the live feed
How do we prevent FPS drops and camera feed freezing
How do we maintain lighting and camera positions?

Open Challenge:
How does the car steer without hitting the walls?
How do we manage turns?
When do we end a round?

Obstacle:
Where do we pick back up from the open challenge code?
How do we avoid obstacles? and handle different cases
How do we turn the car with obstacles on the field?

Parking:
How do we leave the parking, and how do we understand direction?
How do we enter the parking spot after 3 rounds?
How do we manage color detection between red pillars and magenta parking lot walls.
