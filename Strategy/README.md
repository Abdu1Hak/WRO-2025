# Strategy

Strategy is an integral part of the game, an effient startegy means a fast and accurate run.

## Open Challenge

For the open challenge, we desire a run that is quick and smooth, expecially within the turns. As explained in [README](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/dfc7f705017f9500a0f3fc7fe9a5bc044949d359/README.md), we use the difference in the contours of the inner and outer walls to control the servo so we can remain in the centre of the straights. Adjusting the the factor by which we reduce the steering helps to keep reduce jerkiness and increase reliability.

## Obstacle Challenge

For the Open Challenge, there is an important decision for every team to make at the start of every season, what should be prioritized, speed or accuracy? We selected accuracy, meaning our robot is quite slow, coming close to the time limit of three minutes, but ensuring we have adequate distance to detect and avoid the obstacles, making our run more consistent.
