# This folder contains all of our source code:

[Button_Obstacle_Challenge.py](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/dfc7f705017f9500a0f3fc7fe9a5bc044949d359/src/Button_Obstacle_Challenge.py) is our most recent version of the Obstacle Challenge.

[Camera.py](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/dfc7f705017f9500a0f3fc7fe9a5bc044949d359/src/Camera.py) is a code that simply opens the camera with editable ROIs that we use to test what the robot detects/sees.

[Final_Open_Challenge.py](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/dfc7f705017f9500a0f3fc7fe9a5bc044949d359/src/Final_Open_Challenge.py) is our final code for the Open Challenge.

[Get_Ranges.py](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/dfc7f705017f9500a0f3fc7fe9a5bc044949d359/src/Get_Ranges.py) is the code we run to detect and retrieve the Lab values from the game field for our robot to detect. It works by opening a live camera view and a seperate video feed with slider that help us to adjust and finalize the values.

[Parking.py](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/dfc7f705017f9500a0f3fc7fe9a5bc044949d359/src/Parking.py) is our current attempt to enter the parking spot at the end of our run. This is where we test before integrating it with our main code.

[U-Open-Challenge.py](https://github.com/Abdu1Hak/WRO-2025/blob/dfc7f705017f9500a0f3fc7fe9a5bc044949d359/src/U-Open-Challenge.py) is one of our backup Open Challenge code that we can revert back to if ever need be.
